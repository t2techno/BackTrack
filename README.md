# BackTrack

Android app that allows you to save your GPS coordinates and take a picture of site, then saves them for recall later when going back to the location. Can be used when visiting a new place and trying to get back to a hotel after driving around, saving your parking spot at large venues, saving neat locations when hiking, etc.
